# 1-Million-Dice-Rolls-probability
This is just a funky little idea i had where i wanted to see what will the probability look like if someone were to roll a DICE a MILLION times 


for running it all you have to do is use the data that i have already created using MAIN.PY and sorted all ONE MILLION of my data thru SORT.PY , all of the data is stored into RANDNUM.TXT and then i used GRAPH.PY to GRAPH the data in a cool way for you to see it
